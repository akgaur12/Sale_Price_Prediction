# Sale Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the Sale Price Prediction using Python Project repository! This project is focused on predicting sale prices for real estate properties using machine learning techniques. Whether you're a data enthusiast, a real estate professional, or just curious about predictive analytics, this project offers valuable insights into predicting prices accurately.

## Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Explore and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and transform features to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features and create new ones to enhance the model's performance.
- **Model Selection:** Experiment with different regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and more.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using metrics like Mean Squared Error, R-squared, and Cross-Validation to choose the best performing one.
- **Prediction:** Use trained models to make predictions on new real estate properties' sale prices.

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_url>`.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Explore the Notebooks:** Navigate to the `notebooks` directory to find Jupyter notebooks that guide you through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

4. **Contribute:** If you're interested in contributing, feel free to submit pull requests with enhancements, bug fixes, or new features.
